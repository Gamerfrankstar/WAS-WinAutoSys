# WAS-WinAutoSys
Simple Windows poweshell script that'll run with custom ISO images

## This is a simple script made for easy deployment of Windows 11 VMs, automatically setting up essential tools and configurations. 
### Here’s what it does:
- Removes the Microsoft Edge icon from the desktop for a cleaner workspace.
- Install Different Softwares on a system. (Browser, VPN, Torrenting, Text Editor and File Archiever)
- Creates an RDP user so you can connect to the VM directly. (Be cautious with security settings to prevent unauthorized access.)
- Message Output to Discord to let you know VM is ready to connect to via RDP.
  
That’s it! This script automates my VM setup, making it ready to go with the tools I need.
